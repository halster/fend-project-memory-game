If you find all 8 matches in less than 10 moves you get three stars.  If you win in less than 13 moves you have 2 stars, less than 16 is 1 star and 16 or over moves is 0 stars.

My udacity mentor helped me figure out the timer function.  I also used Matthew Cranford's tutorials to help figure out how to get started.  Adam-in from slack also helped me figure out how to disable clicking on the same card twice in a row for a match.   My coding friends on slack were also very helpful with encouragement and tips.
